### Manually install Docker engine
Step 1: Download the Docker .tgz Archive

First, you'll need to download the docker-26.1.0.tgz file. 
```sh
wget https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/docker-26.1.0.tgz
```
Step 2: Extract the Archive
Once downloaded, transfer the .tgz file to your SLES server and navigate to the directory where you've placed the file. Extract the contents using the tar command:
```sh
tar xzvf docker-26.1.0.tgz
```
This will extract Docker's binaries, such as dockerd (the Docker daemon), docker (the Docker client command), and others into a folder.

Step 3: Move Docker Binaries to a System Directory
After extracting the files, move the Docker binaries to a directory in your system's PATH to make them accessible as commands. A common choice is /usr/local/bin/:
```
sudo mv docker/* /usr/local/bin/
```
Step 4: Start Docker Daemon
Before starting the Docker daemon, you might want to ensure that no other Docker processes are running:
```
sudo systemctl stop docker
```
Now, you can start the Docker daemon manually:

```
sudo dockerd &
```
To run the Docker daemon in the background, you might want to use a more robust method for managing the service, such as creating a systemd service file.

Step 5: Create a systemd Service File (Optional but Recommended)
For Docker to start automatically at boot and to be manageable with systemd commands (start, stop, status, etc.), create a systemd service file:

Create a new file named docker.service in /etc/systemd/system/:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker.service
```
Paste the following content into the file:
```
[Unit]
Description=Docker Application Container Engine
Documentation=https://docs.docker.com
After=network-online.target firewalld.service
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/dockerd
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
TimeoutSec=0
RestartSec=2
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```
Reload systemd to recognize the new service:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Start Docker and enable it to start at boot:
```
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
Step 6: Verify Docker Installation
Check that Docker is correctly installed and running:
```
docker --version
```
And test running a Docker container:
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```
This method of installing Docker provides flexibility but requires manual management of updates and security patches. Always ensure that you're downloading Docker from a trusted source to avoid security risks.

### Install Compose V2

Step 1: Locate the Binary

Ensure that the docker-compose-Linux-x86_64 file is in a directory where you have write permissions, or move it to such a directory if necessary. If you've just downloaded it, make sure it's in a convenient location, such as your home directory or /tmp.
```
wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.27.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64
```
Step 2: Make the Binary Executable
Change the permissions of the binary to make it executable. You can do this with the following command:
```
chmod +x docker-compose-linux-x86_64
```
Step 3: Move the Binary to a Directory in Your PATH
Move the now-executable binary to a directory within your systemâ€™s PATH to allow it to be run from any location. A common choice is /usr/local/bin/, which is typically included in the system's PATH. You might also rename the binary to docker-compose for ease of use:
```
sudo mv docker-compose-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
for all users:
```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins
sudo mv docker-compose-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```
Step 4: Verify the Installation
To confirm that Docker Compose is correctly installed and accessible, run:
```
docker-compose --version
```
